# 🎄👨‍💻 BlackIPS Advent of Code solutions

I chose to participate again in the Advent of Code (www.adventofcode.com) event for the second year in a row, after I'd had to cancel my first try
2022 after just six days to my health conditions. I'd never came back to complete the other puzzles, but 2023 will be the beginning of something new
for me - hopefully.

## 🕰️ History
### 🚽 2022 - My first appearance
As mentioned before, I'd started solving puzzles in my very first AoC event in 2022. My main goal was to get used to Rust 🦀 and improve my low skills
in this very new language. I'd had to give up after just six days and never got back to solve the remaining puzzles.

You will find my solutions in the [2022](./2022/Rust) folder. I'd planed to solve the puzzles in Rust and TypeScript but failed miserable in
completing both.

### 💪🏼 2023 - Come back stronger
In 2023 I'd made progress in learning Rust, having fun with it and got along with its quirks. So I'd like to set focus on some specific topics to
improve my knowledge in testing and tracing, want to get along with documenting according to cargo-doc standard and improve organizing my toolchain
and projects.

I'm focussing on Rust solutions only, mainly without help of third party libraries if possible. Please check out my [2023](./2023) folder to find my
solutions.
