# BlackIPs Advent of Code solutions

I chose to participate in the Advent of Code (www.adventofcode.com) event in 2022. To improve my Rust skills I'd choosen
to write the solutions mainly in Rust, but try to offer solutions for other programming languages as well. 

There are no ambitious goals to achieve, except to improve writing idiomatic code, learning new skills and getting a 
better software engineer. Therefore, I hadn't spent much time in optimizing or benchmarking my code either I'd spent much
time in proper error handling (which I definitely should do...).

## Run a testcase / a solution (Rust)
Every Rust solutions contains a set of test cases, which verifies that the functions should work as described. To run
a solution, `cd` in its directory and invoke either `cargo test` or `cargo run` (or both).

```shell
cd day01
cargo test
cargo run
```

## Feedback
If you have questions or suggestions to improve my code, feeld free to open an issue and ask or provide me your feedback.
I'm programming in Rust just for a couple of weeks and will be happy to receive any suggestions!
