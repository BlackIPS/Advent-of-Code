# Advent of Code 2022

I chose to participate in the Advent of Code (www.adventofcode.com) event for the very first time in 2022. To improve my Rust skills I'd choosen
to write the solutions mainly in Rust, but try to offer solutions for other programming languages as well.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
I don't have any ambitious goals to achieve, so I try to solve all puzzles with no additional libraries if possible. But
first of all I want to improve my Rust skills, become more confident writing code in a yet unknown language and have
some fun.

Therefore, I won't spend much time in optimizing or benchmarking my code neither will I spend much time in proper or
extensive error handling (but which I definitely should do some time...).

## â–¶ How to run a testcase / a solution (Rust)
Every Rust solutions contains a set of test cases, which verifies that the functions should work as described. To run
a solution, `cd` in its directory and invoke either `cargo test` or `cargo run` (or both).

```shell
cd day01
cargo test
cargo run
```

## ðŸ—¨ Feedback
If you have questions or suggestions to improve my code, feeld free to open an issue and ask or provide me your feedback.
I'm programming in Rust just for a couple of weeks and will be happy to receive any suggestions!
